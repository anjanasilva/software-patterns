## Software Patterns

- Singleton Pattern 
 
Singleton pattern is a highly useful pattern which can be extremely useful when used correctly. Singleton pattern ensures that there is only one instance of a class in the system. This is useful for classes that represent resources that should be shared, such as a database connection or a logger.

- Adapter Pattern

The Adapter pattern is a structural design pattern that allows you to make two incompatible interfaces work together. It acts as a bridge between two existing classes to make them work together without modifying their source code.

- Composite Pattern

The Composite pattern is a structural design pattern that allows you to treat individual objects and compositions of objects in a uniform way. This can be useful for representing tree-like structures or for creating reusable components.

- Observer Pattern

The Observer pattern is a behavioural design pattern that allows you to define one-to-many relationships between objects so that when one object changes state, all of its dependents are notified and updated automatically.
